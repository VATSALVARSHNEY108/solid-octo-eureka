# THINK++ Interactive Lesson Design

Use the Bellman-Ford lesson as the reference standard for new simulation lessons. The goal is a beautiful, high-clarity learning page where the definition, complexity, algorithm behavior, and interactive controls all feel like one polished product.

## Visual Theme

The default visual language is high-contrast black and white with carefully limited accent colors. Use CSS variables from the global theme instead of generic Tailwind colors.

Core surfaces:
- Page background: `var(--bg-primary)`
- Card and panel background: `var(--bg-secondary)` or `var(--bg-elevated)`
- Primary text: `var(--text-primary)`
- Secondary text: `var(--text-secondary)`
- Borders: `var(--border-color)` or `var(--border-subtle)`
- Primary accent: `var(--accent-vibrant)`
- Soft accent fill: `var(--accent-soft)`

Lessons may use algorithm-specific semantic accents only where they explain state:
- Blue or primary accent for active/current state
- Green for completed/reached/valid state
- Amber for selected, warning, or recently changed state
- Red for error, invalid state, or negative-cycle style alerts

The UI should work in both light and dark mode. Every major surface, text color, border, canvas grid, control, badge, and simulation state must remain readable in both modes.

## Page Structure

Each full simulation lesson should include:

1. Hero section
   - Topic eyebrow, such as `Graph Algorithms - SSSP`
   - Large lesson title
   - Clear definition in 2-4 lines
   - Time and space complexity tags
   - Primary action that jumps to the simulator

2. Concept guide
   - 3-4 short explanation cards
   - Cover why the algorithm exists, the core operation, edge cases, and performance
   - Keep text readable and practical, not textbook-heavy

3. Interactive simulator
   - Left control/status column
   - Large visual workspace
   - Step-by-step playback
   - Live state panels
   - Code tracker or pseudocode highlighter

## Educational Content Requirements

Every lesson should include:
- Definition of the topic or algorithm
- Why it is used
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Important edge cases
- Step-by-step explanation tied to the simulation state
- Pseudocode or code-tracking panel when the lesson is algorithmic

Complexity should be shown near the top of the page in compact tags:
- Time: example `O(V x E)`
- Space: example `O(V)`

The simulator should reinforce these values by showing the actual data being processed, such as distances, pointers, stacks, queues, arrays, or visited states.

## Simulation UX

The simulation should feel alive and directly manipulable.

Expected interaction features:
- Play, pause, previous step, next step, and reset
- Speed control slider
- Current-step explanation
- Highlighted active operation
- Visual state changes for selected, current, completed, warning, and error states
- Editable inputs where useful
- Clear empty, disabled, and invalid states

For graph-style simulations, support:
- Click background to add a node
- Drag nodes to reposition them
- Shift-drag or source-target selection to connect nodes
- Select and remove nodes or edges
- Right-click delete where appropriate
- Double-click edge weight or label to edit
- Source selector when the algorithm needs a start node

For non-graph lessons, use the same principle:
- Arrays should allow item editing/reordering when useful
- Linked lists should allow node dragging or pointer manipulation where useful
- Trees should allow node placement, insertion, deletion, and traversal playback
- Stack/queue lessons should show push/pop/enqueue/dequeue as animated state changes

## Draggable Panels

Simulation panels should be movable and resizable when they may cover the visualization.

Good draggable panels:
- Distance table
- Pointer table
- Current pass or iteration info
- Pseudocode tracker
- Memory/state inspector
- Explanation panel

Panel behavior:
- Header acts as the drag handle
- Cursor changes to grab/grabbing
- Panels include a resize handle in the bottom-right corner
- Cursor changes to resize when hovering the resize handle
- Resizing should support width and height where useful
- Panels must enforce minimum sizes so text, controls, and code lines do not collapse
- Panels should avoid growing beyond the visible simulation workspace
- Panels have translucent or elevated backgrounds
- Panels use blur/shadow lightly for separation
- Panel text remains readable in light and dark mode
- Panel positions stay inside the visible simulation area when possible
- Resized dimensions should remain stable during playback and step changes

## Canvas And Workspace

The main workspace should be the visual center of the lesson.

Style expectations:
- Large bordered simulation area
- Subtle grid or structured background when it helps placement
- Stable dimensions so controls do not jump
- Nodes, edges, labels, and state badges should not overlap badly
- Active elements should animate or glow subtly
- Hit areas should be larger than visible strokes for easy selection

Avoid making the simulator feel like a small card preview. It should feel like the main tool on the page.

## Controls

Controls should be compact, clear, and close to the simulation.

Use:
- Icon buttons for playback and reset
- Inputs/selects for editable values
- Sliders for speed
- Buttons for concrete commands such as add, join, remove, and reset
- Disabled states when an action is unavailable

Controls should use the lesson theme variables and avoid generic color utilities like `bg-blue-500`.

## Motion And Feedback

Animations should explain state, not decorate randomly.

Use motion for:
- Active edge/node/current pointer
- Newly relaxed or updated value
- Completed/reached state
- Playback step transitions
- Hover and focus feedback

Keep transitions short and calm, usually around `0.2s` to `0.3s`.

## Accessibility And Readability

The lesson must be readable and usable in both modes.

Requirements:
- Strong contrast for text and controls
- Visible focus/hover states
- No text overlap on mobile or desktop
- Responsive layout that stacks simulator controls above the canvas on smaller screens
- Buttons and interactive targets large enough to click comfortably
- Text labels for important values, not color alone

## Linked List Lesson Direction

Linked-list lessons should follow the same Bellman-Ford quality level.

For linked-list simulations:
- Show nodes as connected blocks with visible `data` and `next`/`prev` pointers
- Animate pointer changes during insertion, deletion, reversal, merge, cycle detection, and traversal
- Let users drag nodes or rearrange the workspace when useful
- Include a live pointer/state panel showing values like `head`, `tail`, `current`, `prev`, `slow`, `fast`, or `carry`
- Include a code tracker for algorithmic lessons
- Include definition, time complexity, and space complexity in the hero
- Support light and dark mode with the same variables

The result should look like a finished interactive teaching tool, not a placeholder page.

## Topic-Wise Simulation Plan

All DSA topics should share the same page quality as the Bellman-Ford lesson, but the simulator must match the concept being taught. Do not reuse graph visuals for every topic. Reuse the experience pattern: strong hero, definition, complexity, guide cards, interactive workspace, live state panels, draggable panels, playback, and code tracking.

## Build Order

Recommended rollout:

1. Create one reusable lesson shell based on the Bellman-Ford structure.
2. Build shared UI primitives: hero, complexity tags, guide cards, simulator frame, playback controls, draggable panel, code tracker wrapper, state table.
3. Convert one lesson per topic first as a reference page.
4. Use those reference pages as templates for the remaining lessons in the same topic.
5. Verify every reference page in light and dark mode.
6. Check mobile layout for each simulator type.
7. Fill remaining lessons topic by topic, keeping the concept-specific simulator honest.

## Topic Reference Lessons

Use these as first examples for each topic:
- C++ Fundamentals: variables, loops, functions, pointers
