Let's do. We'll craft patch. We'll ensure file ends properly. Let's redo in correct channel. We'll call functions.apply_patch with patch text. We'll remove mistaken bits. Let's craft carefully. Use ascii. The title replacements: we replaced "To" etc. Might undesired. We'll keep simple: not replacing To/And? Actually earlier we wanted title case; may not require lowercasing. We'll just use proper Title Case but keep "to" and "and" maybe. But ok. For now leave as simple but not messing. We'll remove those replacements to avoid altering "To" in "Introduction To Queue" maybe to "Introduction to Queue" nice. We'll keep as in script. Ok.
